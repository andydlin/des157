            <h1>Topic Choice</h1>
            <p>For the final project, I've chosen to focus on anxiety and stress. The first idea is an interactive experience that will bring awareness to the daily lives of people who deal with anxiety and stress. The second idea is a platform where people can anonymously share their thoughts throughout their day where other people around them can provide emotional support through the platform or maybe even meet up to connect and share.</p>
