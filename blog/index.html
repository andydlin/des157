                <h2>Studio 4: Counting down to Andy's haircut</h2>
                <h3>February 14, 2017</h3>
                <p>For studio 4, I created a countdown to my haircut. I wanted this to be a fun experience where the user can navigate to different phases of my hair. It was really fun making the experience interactive. Users can click the different points of the timeline where the character will animate and walk to the point. Originally I wanted to animate the hair length, but I couldn't figure that out in time so I ended up with an alternative option. I decided to animate a sign that showed what week it is and cover the character and just switch out the hair image. Another interactive feature I added was the ability to use the left arrow, right arrow, spacebar, and "w" keys to control the character. It's kind of like a mini game.</p>

                <h2>Studio 3: Funko Pop! Vinyl Collection</h2>
                <h3>February 7, 2017</h3>
                <p>I chose to create an archive of part of my Funko Pop! Vinyl collection. I've always kept my figures in their boxes, so I wanted to create a fun way to showscase and interact with them. When the page loads, I only show the top of their heads to create curiosity and encourage users to interact with the images. When an image is clicked, the figure inside the box comes into view. When a user hovers over the box, the lid opens to indicate that they can click on the box to take the figure out. Then at the last step of the interaction they can rotate the figure in 360 degrees. Ideally, I would crop out all the images of the figure so that it has a transparent background. I would also animate the figure so that it doesn't have to leave the screen and reappear, there would be a more seamless transition from inside the box and onto the center of the screen.</p>

                <h2>Learning IxD From Everyday Objects</h2>
                <h3>January 31, 2017</h3>
                <p>Almost everyday I write an email through Google's Gmail or Inbox client. It's techincally a form, but it doesn't looks like a traditional form with input fields and labels. The form also sits nicely ontop of the page content, it doesn't need its own page. Even though it doesn't follow the traditional aesthetics of a form, the input fields are familiar because it resembles writing a letter. The form asks for the recipient's address (email address in the "To" field), subject of the letter ("Subject" field), and content of the letter ("Say something" field). The main buttons and actions are grouped at the bottom so it's easy to find. The blue "send" button reacts like a real button press; when you click on it the button looks like it's being pressed down.</p>

                <h2>Sketch App by Bohemian</h2>
                <h3>January 11, 2017</h3>
                <p>Sketch is a design tool built by Bohemian. It's best used for creating user interface designs for web and mobile apps. Sketch has a beautiful and simple interface that lets users focus on creating professional designs without unnecessary tools taking up screen space.</p>
                <p>Photoshop is a jack of all trades where users can edit photos, create graphics, and design interfaces. Illustrator focuses on vector graphics, icons, and also lets users create interfaces. Sketch is like the perfect child between Photoshop and Illustrator but was raised by an awesome uncle that taught Sketch how to get rid of its bad habits from Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
                <p>Sketch’s interface is familiar where it has the toolbars and attributes along the sides of the interface. It’s a smart move by not trying to reinvent the wheel but clean up and enhance the interface instead. The icons and buttons are all clear and easy to understand and the interactions are intuitive.</p>
